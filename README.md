About BadCode.

BadCode is just a developer name for me to name the app study.
BadCode is obtained through sloppy design and lack of maintainability of the code.
the code of the app complexity should limited to low and medium.
Each of app is developed on purposed to be developed/combined into other functionality

Mainly for personal research,
may publish the app publicly if i feel it hehe . . .

Cheers ...
